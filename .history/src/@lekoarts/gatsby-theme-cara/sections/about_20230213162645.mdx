## About

> HyperFlick 2 Royal Hypervisor-based antivirus is a type of antivirus that runs on a hypervisor, which is a layer of software that sits between the operating system and the physical hardware of a computer. The hypervisor is responsible for managing and allocating system resources, such as CPU time and memory, to multiple virtual machines (VMs) running on a single physical machine.

In a hypervisor-based antivirus solution, the antivirus software is integrated into the hypervisor, providing an additional layer of security that is separate from the operating system and the individual VMs running on the physical machine. This allows the antivirus to scan and protect the virtual environment, including the VMs, from threats such as malware, viruses, and other malicious software.

One advantage of hypervisor-based antivirus is that it can provide a more comprehensive level of protection, as it has access to all of the VMs and can monitor all activity taking place within the virtual environment. This can help to prevent malicious software from infecting individual VMs or spreading from one VM to another, as well as protecting the physical machine from threats.

Hypervisor-based antivirus solutions can also be more effective in detecting and preventing attacks that target the virtual environment, as they have a deeper understanding of the underlying infrastructure and can identify anomalies and suspicious activity more easily. Additionally, because the antivirus is integrated into the hypervisor, it can provide real-time protection and respond quickly to threats, helping to minimize the impact of an attack.
